# Neet-Code-Training

My attempt at actually learning how to think like a programmer instead of doing random problems on LeetCode with no real thought process.

## Things I hope to learn through this practice

- Understanding and calculating time and space complexity without help from ChatGPT.
- Learning more about testing with pytest.
- Learning how to think about the time and space needed to complete my algorithms instead of just trying to complete them.
